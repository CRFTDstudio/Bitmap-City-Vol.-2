# Bitmap City Vol. 2

## Bitmap City Vol. 2

_Bitmap City Vol. 2_ is the first collection in the field of Digital Matter Theory (DMT) to be built upon photography, redefining digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain. As a pioneering fine art collection, it masterfully blends imagery, bitmap blocks, Pantone color sets, and distinct web3 slang into each piece, challenging the boundaries of fine art and setting a new standard for creativity by seamlessly merging the tangible with the virtual.
