# Bitmap City Vol. 2

**Bitmap City Vol. 2** is the first collection in the field of Digital Matter Theory (DMT) to be built upon photography. As a pioneering fine art collection that redefines digital art on the Bitcoin blockchain, this project masterfully blends imagery, bitmap blocks, Pantone color sets, and distinct web3 slang into each piece.

## Layered Artwork
*Bitmap City Vol. 2* is meticulously designed to be generated in complete layers (.png and .WebP), with varying degrees of opacity and paint.

### High-Resolution Photography
Aerial photography was captured inside of a propeller plane using Canon R5c with Zeiss and Canon prime lenses. Flying altitudes ranged from 5,000 to 10,000 feet to provide ample variations in the topography of cities, towns, and farmland. The high-resolution photography forms the foundation of each artwork, bringing a tangible element to the digital space. There are a total of 25 color photographs and 25 B&W photographs for a base layer of 50.

### Bitmap Blocks
Blocks were chosen for their varying formations, historical significancies, and digital counterparts to the physical captures. These "digital cities" pair with the landscape photography to represent a meshing of the physical and digital. Bitmap blocks also provide a grounding of the artwork visually, linking it to Bitcoin’s immutable legacy.

### Pantone Colors
The choice to utilize Pantone’s Colors of the Year as the color pallete was an intentional decision to mimic DMT's non-arbritary nature. The colors are set, one for each year, and will forever be the same. They serve as a connection to the cultural zeitgeist of the past 15 years and tie the collection to significant moments in time, adding depth and resonance to the pieces.
2009 was chosen as the starting year, the same year that birthed Bitcoin:
